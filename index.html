            Fellow citizens of the world: </p>
        <p>

            We meet in an hour of challenge and opportunity. With our eyes fixed on the stars, we choose to make cat girls real in this decade, not because it is easy, but because we want to be fluffy.

            For more than a century, man has sought to create a being to share our lives with. Now, we are ready to take the next step and make our dreams a reality. We have the technology, the resources, and the determination to make this happen.

            Our mission is to create the first real cat girl. We will use our resources to create a hybrid creature that combines the best of both worlds. We will create a creature that is both human and feline, a creature that is capable of living among us, learning from us, and sharing our lives.

            We will not be deterred by the difficulties that stand in our way. We will use our ingenuity and our courage to make this dream a reality. We will make it possible for us to live with a creature that is both human and feline.

            This is not just a scientific challenge; it is a moral one as well. We will use our resources responsibly and ethically, so that the creatures we create can live in harmony with us, and with each other.

            This is a great undertaking. It is a task that will require dedication and hard work. But it is a task that is worthy of our best efforts. We will make cat girls real.
